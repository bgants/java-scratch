JS - PROXY is running!

<p>The general idea here is to have this proxy make a request on your behalf and then return the response to you so as to avoid the 'Same Origin Poily Issue'</p>
<p>Usage should be something like: /JSProxy/proxy?url=http://api.openbeerdatabase.com/v1/breweries.json.</p>

<p>Keep in mind if your using a different port its still a cross site issue.. deploy your app in the same contianer as the JS-proxy</p>
